# Quadreal-AI-Challenge
1st Place Winner Quadreal AI Challenge 🏆  Using ML to predict mission IoT sensor data

**Devpost Link: https://devpost.com/software/quadreal-challenge**

### Summary 📖
- This is our submission to Quadreal AI Challenge organized by uWaterloo Data Science Club
- In this Kaggle-style competition the goal is to ML to predict mission IoT sensor data
- Using a combination of clever feature engineering techniques and XGBoost we won the **first place prize** in this competition

### What it does 🧠
- We devise a solution to predict missing values for IAQ sensor data in the occasion of outages. 
- We also propose a solution for detecting anomalies to be used by sensors to flag abnormal air conditions.

### How we built it 🛠️
- **Doing Analysis on Time Series Data**: Analyzing time series data about trends, seasonality, cyclical etc.
- **K-Fold Mean Target Encoding**: This feature made the biggest different in our MSE score.
- **XGBoost**: Our versatile classification model.
- **Isolation Forest**: Useful for anomaly detection.
